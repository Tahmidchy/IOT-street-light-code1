street light project source code 1
This is a portion of my research for my academic final-year project, through which I have worked to modernize street lights in order to save power and tax money by Up to 60%. I have also suggested ways to link more cutting-edge technology and real-time fault detection. With this, I hope to build the smart city of my dreams.
