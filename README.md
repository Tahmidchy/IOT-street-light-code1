This is a portion of my research for my academic final-year project, through which I have worked to modernize street lights in order to save power and tax money by Up to 60%. I have also suggested ways to link more cutting-edge technology and real-time fault detection. With this, I hope to build the smart city of my dreams.

Great news! Alhamdulillah Our research article was approved for the IEEE 3rd ECCE International Conference, with the IEEE conference version publication process currently underway. It's worth noting that approximately 40% of the world's energy is being wasted due to the poor management of street lights, resulting in a market value of $20 billion - equivalent to the GDP of some entire nations.
